============================

All files and assignments created during Fall 2018 semester of CPSC 121 at Gonzaga University

## Homework 1:
This was a paper assignment I no longer have access to

## Homework 2: C++ Syntax
Introduction to the C++ programming language through the creation of 5 basic programs as well as correcting errors in code examples
1.	Program holds the price of five items in variables and displays each price and the total price including sales tax. Practices usage of variables.
1.	Program assesses the value of of a piece of property and displays the value and associated property tax. Introduces handling user input.
1.	Program calculates the average of 5 user inputted test scores. Practices creating clean output as well as setting the precision of outputted numbers.
1.	Program prompts the user to enter two numbers, then the program determines which number is larger. Introduces conditional statements to manage program flow.
1.	Program prompts the user to enter the number of quarters dimes, nickels, and pennies that amount to exactly one dollar. This program incorporates elements of the other 4 programs.

## Homework 3: Loops and Outputs
This homework focuses on practices while and for loops in C++ through the creation of five basic programs as well as correcting errors in code examples
1.	Program prompts the user to enter the speed of the vehicle and the amount of hours it travels, then uses a while loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of the time period. Practices implementing loops with user input
1.	Program outputs the amount of calories burnt in 30 minutes
1.	Program prompts the user to enter a series of integers terminated with the number 99, then outputs the largest and smallest numbers entered by the user. Practices updating variables within a loop
1.	Program prompts user to enter a number no greater than 15, then outputs a square of 'X's. Practices user input checking, as well as creating a clean output
1.	Program opens an output file, then uses a loop to write the numbers 1 - 100 to the file, then closes the file. Introduces manipulating files in C++ programs

## Homework 4: File Input/Output
This homework focuses on more advanced loops and proper input validation with four programs. Also focuses on more advanced file manipulation.
1.	Program loops to get the sum of all numbers up to the user inputed number. Also validates the user input to ensure that it is greater than 0
1.	Program reads from a file of random numbers and calculates the amount of numbers in the file, the sum of all numbers in the file, and the average of all numbers in the file. Practices  
1.	Program predicts the size of a population of organisms using the user inputted starting population and percentage increase, then displays the size of the population each day
1.	Program asks user to enter the day's sales for five stores, then creates a bar graph in an output file representing each store's sales. Practices string manipulation as well as writing to output files

## Homework 5: Functions
This 2-part homework set focuses on implementing functions in C++ for creating modular code
1.	Program implements function called fallingDistance that takes the amount of time it travels as a parameter, then returns the distance in meters the object falls over the time interval formatted in a table
1.	Program implements the future value formula, a model that finds the compound monthly interest of a savings account

## Homework 6: Simple Algorithms
This homework set practices creating more advanced functions that require more complicated algorithms for sorting and analysis
1.	Program determines which of a company's four divisions had the highest sales through the use of the findHighest() algorithm that parses division sales. 
1.	Program calculates the average of a group of test scores where the lowest test score is dropped
1.	Program checks if a user inputted number is prime or not

## Homework 7: Arrays
This homework set practices implementing and manipulating arrays in C++
1.	Program lets user enter 10 numbers into an array, then returns the largest and smallest numbers in the array
1.	Programs prompts the user to enter the total rainfall for 12 months into an array, then calculates the total rainfall, average rainfall, and months with highest and lowest amounts for the year
1.	Program implements a function that accepts 3 arguments: an array, the size of the array, and a number n, then displays all numbers in the array that are greater than n
1.	Program stores the correct answers to a multiple choice test, then compares the correct answers to another array of student answers and outputs the amount of correct and incorrect questions

## Theater Seats Project
This project practices creating a projects that uses the three-file format of .h, .cpp, and Makefile to implement a system for displaying reserved and unreserved theater seats. This project combines elements of all the homeworks.

## Tic-Tac-Toe
Project implements the game of Tic-Tac-Toe using elements of all the homeworks and the three-file format in order to ensure the game runs correctly
